\chapter{System Evalidation and Testing}
\label{chapter:testing_validation}

This chapter presents testing and validation results that demonstrate the system's readiness for production deployment through both technical performance validation and user experience evaluation. All tests were conducted on a MacBook Air M2 (Apple M2 chip, 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU) with 16GB RAM running macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, providing consistent baseline measurements for performance benchmarks. The validation approach combines backend technical testing with human-centered usability evaluation across multiple dimensions. Technical validation includes unit testing infrastructure with 60.44\% coverage across 551 functions, performance benchmarking with measured throughput and latency metrics, \ac{ai} processing validation, and security assessment. User experience validation involved 17 participants from the University of Aveiro, comprising both administrative staff and students, evaluating interface effectiveness and adoption potential.

\section{Backend Testing Infrastructure} \label{section:backend_testing}

Testing forms the foundation for system reliability, particularly in production environments where data integrity and user trust are paramount. The UAchado system requires validation given its role in managing personal property and processing sensitive user data through \ac{ai} algorithms that directly impact retrieval success rates.

\subsection{Unit Testing Framework} \label{subsection:unit_testing_framework}

The testing infrastructure uses pytest\footnote{\url{https://docs.pytest.org/}} with pytest-asyncio\footnote{\url{https://pytest-asyncio.readthedocs.io/}} for the multi-tenant architecture. The framework includes 43 test files organised across three architectural layers with 551 test functions.

\subsubsection{Framework Configuration and Test Organisation}

The pytest configuration defines seven test markers for selective execution: unit, integration, e2e, slow, ai, security, and performance. Test discovery follows standard Python conventions with automatic detection of \texttt{test\_*.py} files and \texttt{Test*} classes. The service layer contains 15 test files with 50.49\% component coverage, the repository layer has 10 files with 62.49\% coverage, and the router layer includes 11 files with 68.17\% coverage focused on unit testing.

\subsubsection{Testing Patterns and Mock Infrastructure}

Tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern \cite{Wake2001,Beck2002} with mock objects replacing external dependencies. The mock infrastructure includes MockPocketBaseClient for database simulation, MockOllamaClient for \ac{ai} services, MockTokenManager for authentication, and MockQueueService for asynchronous processing.

The testing architecture uses Factory Boy\footnote{\url{https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/}} with Faker\footnote{\url{https://faker.readthedocs.io/}} for generating realistic test data through 14 specialised factory classes covering core domain entities like UserFactory, FoundItemFactory, CommunityFactory, and many others. Shared utility functions were also created to support common testing operations.

\subsubsection{Environment Configuration and Isolation}

Configuration management via \texttt{conftest.py} handles environment setup, dependency mocking, and resource cleanup. Test isolation prevents interdependencies by automatically resetting mock state between executions. Coverage reporting generates both HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) reports with a 70\% minimum threshold requirement, integrating with static analysis tools for quality assurance.

\subsection{Integration Testing Implementation} \label{subsection:integration_testing_implementation}

Integration testing validates the interaction between system components through real database connections and \ac{api} endpoint verification. The test suite includes 47 integration tests using \texttt{@pytest.mark.integration} markers, covering database operations with PocketBase, multi-service coordination, and \ac{ai} processing pipelines.

Database integration tests operate against a test PocketBase instance with real \ac{crud} operations and schema validation. Tests confirm the database schema implementation, including both successful operations and constraint violations, maintaining data integrity across the multi-tenant boundaries.

Endpoint integration testing uses FastAPI's TestClient\footnote{\url{https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/}} for full request-response cycle validation, covering all \ac{api} endpoints with request-response cycle validation.

Lastly, external service integration focuses on Ollama and \ac{llava} \ac{ai} services through controlled test environments. Tests validate image processing workflows, queue management systems, and error handling for service unavailability. The implementation includes circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms to maintain stability during possible external service disruptions.

% ____________________ Performance Testing and Validation ____________________ %

\section{Performance Testing and Validation} \label{section:performance_testing}

System performance directly impacts user experience and operational efficiency within public environments where response times affect daily workflows. Performance bottlenecks in lost property management can delay reunification processes, while inefficient \ac{ai} processing may reduce matching accuracy during peak usage periods when multiple items are reported simultaneously.

\subsection{Test Execution Performance} \label{subsection:test_execution_performance}

Test execution performance supports efficient development workflow with suite execution in 47 seconds for unit tests and 3.2 minutes, including integration tests. Database integration tests show consistent execution times with standard deviation under 150ms, indicating stable test environment performance. Mock service implementations execute 95\% faster than live service calls while preserving test accuracy through realistic response simulation.

Test isolation prevents interdependencies through automatic mock state reset between executions, achieving 100\% test independence verification. Performance bottlenecks occur during database schema setup and \ac{ai} service mock initialisation, addressed through shared fixture caching and parallel test execution, respectively.

\subsection{System Load Testing and Throughput Analysis} \label{subsection:system_load_testing}

System load testing demonstrates stable performance up to 500 concurrent connections using the test framework. Authentication endpoints maintain response times under 467ms even at maximum load, while standard \ac{crud} operations achieve consistently low latency with P95 times reaching 148ms at peak concurrent usage. Database operations perform well, staying under 278ms response times across all tested load scenarios.

Figure \ref{fig:load_testing_results} illustrates the performance characteristics for standard operations and shows the \ac{ai} processing performance under concurrent load conditions.

        \label{fig:load_testing_ai}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Load Testing Results}
    \label{fig:load_testing_results}
\end{figure}

Throughput measurements show 767 requests per second for standard operations under optimal conditions, with \ac{ai}-enhanced search functionality achieving 4.2 requests per second due to external processing requirements. Stress testing confirms system stability under sustained load with continuous 5-minute operation tests maintaining consistent performance. The testing framework validates production readiness through monitoring of response times, error rates, and resource utilisation patterns.

\subsection{\acs{ai} Processing Performance Validation} \label{subsection:ai_processing_validation}

\ac{ai} processing performance testing focuses on Ollama and \ac{llava} integration with measured image processing latency averaging 18-52 seconds per image analysis depending on load conditions. Queue processing manages \ac{ai} tasks efficiently through asynchronous processing, with response times scaling significantly under concurrent load due to external service dependencies.

The system degrades gracefully under capacity limits without failure. \ac{ai} matching accuracy remains consistent at 94.2\% under both light and heavy load conditions, showing predictable performance scaling without compromising result quality during peak demand.

The matching algorithm performance analysis shows distinct characteristics between high-confidence and low-confidence matches. Figure \ref{fig:ai_matching_system} demonstrates the accuracy rates achieved for each confidence level and shows the corresponding processing time requirements.

    \label{fig:ai_matching_system}
\end{figure}

\subsection{System Monitoring and Performance Tracking} \label{subsection:monitoring_performance}

System monitoring infrastructure uses Prometheus metrics collection with 24 custom metrics and Grafana visualisation through 4 dashboards containing 38 monitoring panels. The monitoring system maintains 5-15 second refresh rates for critical metrics while ensuring zero \ac{pii} exposure in collected telemetry data.

Operational monitoring covers system health through sustained load testing with 1,446 requests per second throughput capability. The monitoring infrastructure validates 100\% system availability during testing periods with error tracking, maintaining zero critical incident reports. Alert configuration testing verifies responsive notification systems for performance degradation and service availability issues.

% ____________________ Security and Authentication Testing ____________________ %

\section{Security and Authentication Testing} \label{section:security_testing}

Security failures in university systems can expose personal data and compromise institutional trust, making thorough security testing essential for production deployment. Besides that, the multi-tenant architecture also introduces additional complexity where access control failures could allow cross-community data exposure, violating privacy expectations and institutional policies.

\subsection{Authentication Framework Validation} \label{subsection:authentication_validation}

The authentication framework uses token-based validation with auto-refresh capability and maintains sub-300ms P99 performance across ordinary users, local managers, and system administrators.

The \ac{rbac} testing suite verifies collection-level permissions through PocketBase integration, covering the 17-collection schema implementation detailed in Chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}. Token management testing includes session lifecycle validation, automatic refresh mechanisms, and cross-role permission verification. The test suite achieves 95\% coverage for the token manager component with over 100 test cases covering authentication paths and edge cases, including expired tokens, invalid credentials, and concurrent session management.

\subsection{Security Controls and Data Protection} \label{subsection:security_controls}

Security implementation testing verifies input sanitisation, file upload restrictions, and data privacy protection through field-level masking services. Pydantic\footnote{\url{https://docs.pydantic.dev/}} schema validation testing covers email, name, description, and location data protection with zero \ac{pii} exposure incidents recorded during testing.

File upload security testing includes media type validation, size restrictions, and temporary file management through dedicated test utilities. The upload handling tests verify file processing workflows within service operations, maintaining 41\% coverage for file handling components.

Rate limiting and access control testing show the system supports 1,604 requests per second peak throughput with 100\% success rate under 200 concurrent connections. \ac{cors} configuration testing maintains a zero error rate against the target threshold of less than 0.1\%. Data isolation testing verifies community-based access control through multi-tenant boundaries, preventing cross-community data access through SQL injection prevention via PocketBase abstraction layers.

% ____________________ Test Coverage and Quality Assessment ____________________ %

\section{Test Coverage and Quality Assessment} \label{section:test_coverage_quality}

Coverage analysis reveals the reliability foundation supporting production deployment, where untested code paths represent potential failure points that could affect user experience or data integrity. Understanding coverage distribution across architectural layers helps prioritize testing efforts and identify components requiring additional validation before live deployment.

\subsection{Coverage Analysis and Metrics} \label{subsection:coverage_analysis}

Test coverage analysis shows 60.44\% overall coverage across 551 test functions distributed across 43 test files organised into three architectural layers. The service layer contains 15 test files with 50.49\% component coverage, the repository layer has 10 files with 62.49\% coverage, and the router layer includes 11 files with 68.17\% coverage focused on unit testing.

Figure \ref{fig:coverage_breakdown} provides a breakdown of coverage percentages across architectural layers and key components, illustrating the testing depth for critical system components.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/chapter5/coverage_by_layer.png}
        \caption{Coverage by Architectural Layer}
        \label{fig:coverage_by_layer}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/chapter5/coverage_by_component.png}
        \caption{Coverage by Key Components}
        \label{fig:coverage_by_component}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Test Coverage Breakdown}
    \label{fig:coverage_breakdown}
\end{figure}

Critical authentication components achieve 95\% coverage for token management and community repository operations, while service layer components like CommunityService reach 84\% coverage. The exception handling utilities maintain 90\% coverage, and analytics services achieve 77\% coverage. Coverage gaps primarily occur in error handling, edge cases, and administrative functions with lower usage frequency.

The testing suite reaches a 98.2\% pass rate, including integration tests and end-to-end scenarios. Static analysis integration through pytest-cov\footnote{\url{https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/}} generates coverage reports identifying untested code paths and potential quality improvements.

\subsection{Quality Assurance and System Reliability} \label{subsection:quality_reliability}

Static analysis quality metrics show 92.5\% confidence across tested components, indicating production readiness. Quality assurance results include zero critical security findings during vulnerability scanning and 100\% uptime during sustained testing periods. Error handling testing verifies proper exception propagation across service boundaries with sanitised error messages, preventing sensitive data exposure.

Coverage prioritisation targets high-impact authentication and data processing components over administrative functions. The testing gaps primarily affect business logic components with lower usage frequency and router tests that experience import dependencies. Coverage reports guided prioritisation of additional test cases, improving system reliability while de-prioritising tests for less critical paths with minimal impact on system quality.

% ____________________ Usability and User Experience Evaluation ____________________ %

\section{Usability and User Experience Evaluation} \label{section:usability_evaluation}

Following the technical validation that confirmed the system's readiness for production deployment, this section examines the system's usability from the end-user perspective. The evaluation was performed with 17 participants from the University of Aveiro, comprising both administrative staff and students, to validate the system's usability across different user groups and operational contexts.

\subsection{Usability Testing Protocol} \label{subsection:usability_protocol}

The usability testing followed a structured approach designed to evaluate the system's interface across different user roles and functional requirements. Testing sessions were conducted individually with each participant, lasting approximately ten to fifteen minutes per session. Each session included demographic data collection, completion of structured task scenarios, and collection of qualitative feedback regarding the user experience.

The testing environment replicated real-world usage conditions, with security guard participants accessing the web application through Brave\footnote{https://brave.com} web browser on a desktop computer, while student participants used the mobile application on an iPhone. All sessions were conducted in Portuguese to provide natural interaction for the mostly Portuguese-speaking university community. Participants provided informed consent for data collection and could withdraw from testing at any time without consequences.

The methodology emphasised task-based evaluation. Participants completed realistic scenarios that reflected their expected interactions with the system in operational contexts. The methodology assessed both functional usability and the system's ability to support actual workflows within the university environment.

The following four task scenarios were developed to evaluate different aspects of system functionality across user roles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first task required participants to report the water bottle present in the test environment as a lost item, including description entry and basic location information. Participants had to navigate through the item submission process, describing the bottle's characteristics and specifying where it was last seen.
    \item Secondly, participants were asked to search for a specific lost item using the system's search interface. The item in question was a black laptop backpack reported a few days earlier. This required them to browse through available items and use basic search functionality to locate the target item.
    \item The third task evaluated the item viewing process, where participants were asked to review the details of a found smartphone and understand where the item was delivered, as well as its current location. This assessed the information presentation and user interaction flow.
    \item The last task assessed basic administrative functions, where security guard participants were asked to update the status of a resolved lost item case.
\end{enumerate}

Success criteria included task completion rates, time to completion, error rates, and subjective satisfaction ratings. Participants were observed for navigation difficulties, confusion points, and areas where additional guidance or interface improvements might be beneficial.

\subsection{User Interface Assessment Results} \label{subsection:ui_assessment}

The usability testing involved 17 participants from the University of Aveiro community, a small but representative sample of the system's intended user base. The participant group included three security guards representing administrative users and 14 students representing ordinary users. Students would primarily use the system to report and search for lost items.

Figure \ref{fig:user_demographics} presents a breakdown of participant demographics, illustrating the distribution between user types, age ranges, experience levels, and platform usage patterns.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/chapter5/demographics_distribution.png}
        \caption{Participant Distribution}
        \label{fig:demographics_distribution}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/chapter5/demographics_age.png}
        \caption{Age Distribution}
        \label{fig:demographics_age}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{User Demographics Breakdown}
    \label{fig:user_demographics}
\end{figure}

The security guard participants, aged between 42 and 67, had basic computer literacy and prior experience handling lost property through traditional paper-based systems. Using the web application, their feedback provided insights into administrative workflow integration and the system's ability to support professional property management responsibilities.

The student participants, aged 19-24, included participants from various academic backgrounds and represented the primary user demographic for lost item reporting and searching. Using the mobile application, this group demonstrated familiarity with mobile interfaces, providing feedback on mobile interface design conventions and user experience expectations.

Task completion analysis revealed successful performance across most scenarios. Task 1 (reporting the water bottle) achieved a 92\% completion rate, with all but one student successfully submitting the lost item report. The single incomplete attempt was attributed to uncertainty about the location field formatting rather than interface design issues. Security guards were not asked to complete this task, as item reporting falls outside their typical responsibilities.

Figure \ref{fig:task_completion} provides an analysis of task completion rates across the four testing scenarios, comparing performance between student and security guard participants.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/chapter5/comprehensive_task_completion.png}
    \caption{Task Completion Analysis}
    \label{fig:task_completion}
\end{figure}

Task 2 (searching for the black laptop backpack) showed an 88\% completion rate, with most participants successfully locating the target item using the search functionality. Difficulties were primarily related to understanding which search terms would be most effective rather than navigation issues, suggesting the need for more precise search guidance or suggestion features.

Task 3 (reviewing the smartphone details and understanding delivery location) demonstrated role-specific performance differences, with security guard participants achieving 100\% completion compared to 79\% for student participants. All security guards successfully navigated to the smartphone's detail page and identified where the item was delivered and its current location. At the same time, some students had difficulty locating this information within the interface.

All security guard participants completed Task 4 (updating item status) successfully, with each successfully changing the item status from "pending" to "resolved." Student participants were not asked to complete these administrative tasks due to their role-specific nature.

Qualitative feedback revealed several user experience insights. Security guard participants appreciated the system's structured approach to item documentation, noting improvements over paper-based tracking methods. However, they suggested additional fields for internal notes and status tracking to support their operational workflows better.

Student participants found the reporting interface straightforward and intuitive, with most commenting positively on the visual design and logical information organisation. Several students noted that the system felt familiar compared to other university web applications, suggesting successful adherence to established interface conventions.

Navigation feedback indicated that the main menu structure was clear and logical for both user groups.

\subsection{User Satisfaction and Adoption Analysis} \label{subsection:user_satisfaction}

User satisfaction was assessed through post-task questionnaires adapted for the university context. Participants rated their confidence in using the system, perceived ease of use, and likelihood of future adoption. Security guard participants expressed high confidence in the system's ability to improve their work efficiency, with all three indicating they would prefer the digital system over current paper-based methods. Student participants showed positive reception, with 12 of 14 indicating they would use the system if implemented university-wide. The two neutral responses were attributed to limited personal experience with lost property situations rather than system design concerns.

Error recovery assessment revealed that participants who encountered difficulties were generally able to resolve issues independently or with minimal guidance. The most common error involved form submissions due to missed required fields, suggesting the need for improved field validation feedback.

Response time measurements showed that participants completed basic tasks efficiently, with average completion times of 2.3 minutes for item reporting and 1.8 minutes for item searching. These times compare favorably with estimated completion times for traditional paper-based reporting processes.

Based on testing results, several interface improvements would improve user experience and adoption potential. Form validation should provide immediate feedback for required fields, reducing submission errors and some user frustration. Search functionality would benefit from auto-suggestion features to help users formulate effective search queries. Administrative interface enhancements should include expanded note-taking capabilities and customisable status categories to better support security guard workflows. Mobile interface optimisation represents a priority improvement area. Several participants suggested improvements to the mobile interface design, including larger touch targets and simplified navigation.

Overall, the testing validated the system's fundamental design approach while identifying specific enhancement opportunities.
