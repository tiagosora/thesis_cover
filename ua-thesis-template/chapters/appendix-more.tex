\section{Complete List of Defined System Requirements} \label{app:ad-system-requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system must consider the three types of users: ordinary users, capable of simple actions such as searching for items, reporting their lost belongings, and communicating inside the communities; local managers, responsible for managing the \ac{lf}, inserting new items, updating the status of items and other managing tasks; and system administrators, the ones able to make changes in their system configurations, manage the communities and the users, and access all system logs.

% \section*{Quality Attributes} \label{app:ad-quality-attributes}

% \subsubsection*{Scalability}

% The platform must support a growing user base and increasing item-tracking demands as adoption spreads across diverse locations. To achieve this, a microservices architecture is proposed, enabling the independent scaling of critical components such as user management and item management.

% \subsubsection*{Reliability}

% Reliability fosters user trust and is vital for the platform's credibility among stakeholders. To achieve this, fault-tolerant mechanisms, such as, distributed databases, redundant servers, and failover strategies, should be implemented to secure high availability (targeting 99\% uptime) and minimise downtime. Automated monitoring and self-healing protocols must be implemented in order to achieve proactive fault detection and resolution, reducing the "Mean Time to Repair" (MTTR)\footnote{\url{https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/common-metrics}} and ensuring uninterrupted service delivery.

% \subsubsection*{Security}

% Given the sensitive nature of the data involved - ranging from personal user information to potentially high-value lost items - the platform adopts a security-first approach. Data encryption needs be applied both in transit and at rest to protect against breaches. Secure authentication and granular authorisation mechanisms should also be implemented.

% \subsubsection*{Usability}

% Designed for a broad spectrum of users, including those with minimal technical expertise, the platform prioritises an intuitive and accessible interface. By applying \ac{ui} and \ac{ux} best practices, the system should deliver seamless navigation for reporting and retrieving lost items. Multilingual support and visual guidance should cater to diverse user demographics, in order to optimise the user experience.

% \subsubsection*{Observability}

% To ensure operational excellence, the platform must integrate observability tools that capture logs, metrics, and traces, enabling real-time and long-term monitoring. These tools' propose is to facilitate the quick detection and resolution of performance issues, provide insights into user interactions, and support continuous improvement efforts. Observability must secure that the platform remains adaptable, driving both user satisfaction and operational efficiency.

\section{Project Scope} \label{app:ad-project-scope}

The project scope of this research centres on developing an intelligent, integrated solution to streamline the management of \ac{lf} across various public and private environments. Traditional approaches to managing lost items are often inefficient, manual, unstructured, and confusing, leading to increased workloads for personnel responsible for these items and frustration for owners trying to reclaim their property. The scope, therefore, focuses on creating a system that not only automates but also optimises \ac{lf} management by leveraging artificial intelligence, security frameworks, and user-centred design principles. This system is envisioned to handle multiple scenarios, from locating lost items to verifying their rightful owners.

To achieve this, the project proposes a full-stack platform that utilises image recognition for item identification, \ac{nlp} for intuitive search capabilities, and monitoring tools to guarantee system stability and accountability. The platform aims for an accessible and efficient user experience, providing features that serve both item owners and administrators. It may also include community-oriented functionalities to ensure that individuals can recover their lost items through collaboration and communication. Ultimately, the project should differentiate itself by integrating advanced multimodal matching in order to improve user satisfaction and operational efficiency and, mainly, increase the likelihood of successful item recovery.

The final deliverable will be a system accessible through two platforms validated with extensive testing in controlled and real-world settings. Designed with adaptability in mind, these platforms should provide scalability for varied contexts and the multiple expected user needs (described in functional requirements \ref{app:ad-system-requirements}). Through continuous prototyping and user feedback, this project seeks to refine the solution into a reliable, intelligent, and secure system that improves lost property management processes and delivers an enhanced user experience.
